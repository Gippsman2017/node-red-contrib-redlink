v 1.1.6 Add support for user to provide their own certificate for each store- defaults to self signed
    Show status on store node- if unable tos tart server on the listen address, the store node will have a red icon
v 1.1.5 Added a flag to stop redlinkStore globalConsumer inserts from southBound stores.
	Fixed a bug where North Stores forget to remove south peers from their stores when the south peer is no longer connected
	it was causing the south store being updated from the north store regardless.
v 1.1.4 Updated the Readme for more clarity indicating Redlink configurations and added an Index.
v 1.1.3 Added the capability for North stores to delete South store entries when South Stores are not
        contactable during reSync. All registration entries are also removed.
        Also deleted North Store registrations from the South stores when unable to contact North stores during reSync.   
v 1.1.2 Bug fix- msg.topic appears in producer destination drop down twice
v 1.1.1 Changed the Store Sync algorythm so that a south store with multiple north stores cannot relay
	Changed the Sync timing to ensure that entries are delete/purged correctly.
	Ensured that Node-Red Deploy's cause correct propagation of the services throughout the mesh. 
v 1.0.2 Add ETT to timeout message , notify interval to repeatedly notify consumers of messages
v 1.0.1	Changed the SSL key size to 2048 (was 1024), required by new v2 spec.
	Major change required for container issues causing wrong Consumer Updates to be blocked and not cascaded.
	So, replaced the store algorythms for store updates and interconnection resync's
	A New reSync timer has been added (currently 30s) to redlinkStore to enforce ALL north bound registrations.
	The Store and Consumer Registration flow is now:
	  1/ Inform the defined north store of this south connection
	  2/ This South Store sends its Consumer service registrations North
	  3/ The North Store then uses its own reSync timer to cascade the registrations to its north and south peers.
